In the Google BigQuery console, we will process the following commands in that console. 

1. Find repos that contain "AndroidManifest.xml" files.
```SELECT
      repo_name,
      path,
      id
    FROM
      bigquery-public-data.github_repos.files
    WHERE
      path LIKE
        '%AndroidManifest.xml'
```

2. Eliminate duplicate repositories.
```
SELECT
      package
    FROM
      `<found_packages_list>`
    GROUP BY
      package
```
